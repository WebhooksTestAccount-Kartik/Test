Modify collections of issues at once, including these operations:

Bulk edit

Bulk move

Bulk workflow transition

Bulk delete

Some bulk changes may be restricted by project-specific permissions.

Granting permission to make bulk changes may be risky. For example, in a Jira site where anybody can sign up and create issues, a user with this permission and the Add Comments project permission could comment on all accessible issues. It's difficult to undo bulk changes like these.
